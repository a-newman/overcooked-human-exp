      Thank you for participating in our experiment! The purpose of our study is
      to evaluate how well different collaborative AI agents can coordinate with
      humans. In particular, we are testing a new kind of agent that is capable
      of adapting to different partners, including people. In order to evaluate
      different agents, we are having them work together in human-agent teams.
      We are collecting data about the performance of those teams, including
      performance (score) on the game and people's subjective experiences
      coordinating with their partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this study, you collaborated with an agent partner. Data from this
      experiment will be used to evaluate how well your partner collaborates
      with humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your participation will help us design agents that are better at assisting
      and collaborating with humans!
