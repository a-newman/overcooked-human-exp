  <img class="center" src="static/images/space-arrows.png" style="width:250px">
  <p>
    You can move up, down, left, and right using
    the <b>arrow keys</b>, and interact with objects
    using the <b>spacebar</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can interact with objects by facing them and pressing
    <b>spacebar</b>. Here are some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>You can pick up ingredients (onions) by facing
        the ingredient area and pressing <b>spacebar</b>.</li>
      <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing an empty counter,
        and press <b>spacebar</b>, you put the ingredient on the counter.</li>
      <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing a pot that is not full,
        and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will put the ingredient in the pot.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    Note that as you and your partner are moving around the kitchen
    you <u><b>cannot occupy the same location</b></u>.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3 class="text-center">Cooking</h3>
  <img class="center" src="static/images/soup.png" style="width:250px">
  <p>
    Once you put three onions in a pot, the soup will automatically begin cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a soup begins cooking, you'll notice a red number appear over the pot to
    denote the cook time. This number counts upward until the soup is done. Soups take 20 seconds to cook.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the soup is in a bowl, you can serve it by bringing it to
    a grey serving counter.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h3 class="text-center">Score</h3>
  <p>
    When a soup is served at the serving counter, you will receive 20 points.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your goal in this task is to serve as many soups as you can before the game ends!
  </p>

  <br>

  <h3 class="text-center">Task Progression</h3>

  <p>Here is how the task will go:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First, you will answer a couple of demographic questions.</li>
    <li>Then, you will play a "practice" round of Overcooked. In this round, you will play Overcooked by yourself to get familiar with the game controls.</li>
    <li>Then, you will play the game for real with a series of AI partners. Your objective is to deliver as many soups as possible with each partner. After playing with each partner, you will answer some questions about your experience playing with that partner.</li>
  </ol>
