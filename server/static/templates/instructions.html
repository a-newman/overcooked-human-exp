  <h3 class="text-center">Making a Soup</h3>

  <p>
    The goal of the game is to serve as many onion soups as possible. An onion
    soup contains three onions. Here's how you make one.
  </p>

  <p>First, use the arrow keys to move to an onion dispenser:</p>


  <p>Press the space bar to pick up an onion.</p>

  <p>Use the arrow keys to walk to the stove.</p>

  <p>Press the space bar to put the onion in the stove.</p>

  <p>
    Once you put three onions in the pot, the soup will automatically start
    cooking. The soup will take 20 seconds to cook. A countdown timer over the
    soup will show how much time is left for it to cook.
  </p>

  <p>While the soup is cooking, walk over and pick up a dish.</p>

  <p>
    Bring the dish to the stove. Once the soup is done cooking, press the space
    bar to put the soup into the dish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Deliver the soup by bringing it to the serving area and pressing the space
    bar.
  </p>

  <p>The video below shows what delivering a soup looks like.</p>

  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   Once you put three onions in a pot, the soup will automatically begin -->
  <!--   cooking. -->
  <!-- </p> -->
  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   When a soup begins cooking, you'll notice a red number appear over the pot -->
  <!--   to denote the cook time. This number counts upward until the soup is done. -->
  <!--   Soups take 20 seconds to cook. -->
  <!-- </p> -->
  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   Once the soup is in a bowl, you can serve it by bringing it to a grey -->
  <!--   serving counter. -->
  <!-- </p> -->

  <!-- <br /> -->

  <h3 class="text-center">Score</h3>
  <p>When a soup is served at the serving counter, you will receive a point.</p>
  <p>Your goal is to serve as many soups as you can before the game ends!</p>
