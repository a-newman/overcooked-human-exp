            This is what one level of the game looks like:

          <h3 class="text-center">Movement and interactions</h3>
          <img class="center" src="static/images/space-arrows.png" style="width:250px">
          <p>
            You can move up, down, left, and right using
            the <b>arrow keys</b>, and interact with objects
            using the <b>spacebar</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can interact with objects by facing them and pressing
            <b>spacebar</b>. Here are some examples:
            <ul>
              <li>You can pick up ingredients (onions) by facing
                the ingredient area and pressing <b>spacebar</b>.</li>
              <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing an empty counter,
                and press <b>spacebar</b>, you put the ingredient on the counter.</li>
              <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing a pot that is not full,
                and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will put the ingredient in the pot.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            Note that as you and your partner are moving around the kitchen
            you <u><b>cannot occupy the same location</b></u>.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3 class="text-center">Cooking</h3>
          <img class="center" src="static/images/soup.png" style="width:250px">
          <p>
            Once you put three onions in a pot, the soup will automatically begin cooking.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a soup begins cooking, you'll notice a red number appear over the pot to 
            denote the cook time. This number counts upward until the soup is done. Soups take 20 seconds to cook.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the soup is in a bowl, you can serve it by bringing it to
            a grey serving counter.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Score</h3>
          <p>
            When a soup is served at the serving counter, you will receive 20 points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your goal in this task is to serve as many soups as you can before the game ends!
